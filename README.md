## Description

This is a project that builds out an API of a social network (resembling a Twitter type sociall network) using a REST API and Mongoose. 
To use this API, the connection string will need to be updated, a MongoDB will need to be created and connection string updated, and an 'npm install' completed. 
Following those steps, the API may used following a 'npm run start'. Full functionality is explained and demonstrated below.
